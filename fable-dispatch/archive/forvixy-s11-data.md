- **Session-11 decision data (2026-08-09, F31/§11.141 + F32/§11.142 + F33/§11.143):**
  - **§5.74 (search finds no stars/constellations) — the answer is the FIELD:**
    the load never ran; every one of the **2922 files under
    `~/.spacecrafter/sky_cultures` is 0 bytes** (`western-spacecrafter/info.ini`
    included), so the configured culture is rejected ABOVE the loaders — and the
    rejection reaches only stderr while `spacecrafter.log` says `Check
    sky_cultures subdirectory ok` (§5.77). The match itself measured SOUND
    (fixture load on the same launch: 0 → 1085 `(S)` + 3 `(C)`). **Your
    question:** does the delivered `spacecrafter-data` carry sky-culture
    content, or ship it empty? The field-content class now has THREE members
    answered by that one question: `sky_cultures` (2922×0 B), `stellar_systems`
    (13×0 B, §11.109), and the sparse HIP star index (3 of 14 swept ids
    resolve, §11.142(h)).
  - **D28's decision surface grew a concrete member (F33):** old's
    `transition_to body` ends at heading 0 (measured: ramp from 49.139° over
    5 s, start = minus the body's SCREEN axis angle); the new path holds the
    whole orientation (A38). Which ships at a reference switch is exactly
    D28's existing question — nothing new asked, it got a shipped-command
    instance.
  - **§5.85:** `align_with body` measured to NOT align (second call moves
    heading another 25.2°; start-dependent by 29.6°), and its author's inline
    note says why. What the command is FOR only its author or a show that
    wants it can say; 0 shipped scripts use it.
  - **§5.82:** `transition_to point name <X>` DROPS its documented name
    (hard-coded `temp_point`; 19 shipped lines pass names that never had an
    effect). Honouring it changes what shipped lines DO = product decision.
  - **§5.80 (the round's biggest find):** entering free flight TELEPORTS the
    observer ~125° around its reference at constant distance (11 300 km on
    Earth, 99 450 km at Mars, 6354 px on screen vs a 0-px A/A control);
    `selDist` is blind to it by construction. The owed datum (which
    parametrization the free-flight movers were BUILT against) is decision-free
    and next round's dispatch candidate; the FIX that follows is a free-flight
    semantics change = yours.
  - **§5.78 (F31):** `loadSciNames` has no caller (sci-name star search is
    structurally dead) and `updateI18n` drops 1140 loaded names (several names
    per HIP, last wins — one-name-per-star intended?). Rows carry what's owed.
