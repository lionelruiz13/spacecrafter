- **Session-10 veto points (all implemented-and-live, each cheap to reverse;
  silence = endorsed):** (1) F28 removed the shared-buffer send path at ALL
  NINE `send` call sites, not just the overflowing two — every constant answer
  was wire-measured byte-identical pre/post, and the `SMALL_BUFFER` comment's
  never-enforced claim was retired at the site; (2) F29's fix covers TWO sites
  (§5.46 named one — the second is the invisible-reference branch), both pure
  contract-restorations, reversible per-site; (3) the eleven §11 stubs
  (128–138) that had accreted inside §13.C were relocated back to §11 as a
  pure line move, with a boundary marker so the class cannot recur
  (§11.140(h)).
