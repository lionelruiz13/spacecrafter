   - Loaded data `~/.spacecrafter/ssystem.ini` is ISO-8859 and untracked — the Bash
     `grep` wrapper silently excludes it; use `/usr/bin/grep` or Read.
     **[CORRECTED 2026-08-31, F67 executor finding + supervisor measurement: the
     wrapper is ugrep with `-I` — ANY file holding non-UTF-8 bytes is classed binary
     and skipped silently, tracked or not; `src/interfaceModule/app_command_interface.cpp`
     is ~~the one~~ **[CORRECTED 2026-08-31, F69 §11.188(k): ONE OF TWO — the `.hpp`
     of the same name is ISO-8859 as well (18 non-ASCII bytes, already so at
     `dd815ab3~1`); census over all 505 tracked regular files under `src/` finds
     exactly those two]** such file among 500 tracked `src/` files,
     `doc/superscript.sts` another
     (11 hits without `-I`, none with). `/usr/bin/grep` or Read on every ISO-8859 file.
     CLAUDE.md (one file: the code-tree path is a link to `claude/CLAUDE.md`) carries
     the corrected rule.]**
     **[SUPERSEDED IN PART 2026-08-31, F70 §11.189(a) — post-D14 state: every
     tracked CONVERT-set file is pure ASCII (code `cb521cf1`+`71ef30ac`); the
     wrapper hazard survives ONLY in `~/.spacecrafter/ssystem.ini`,
     `doc/superscript.sts` and the EXCLUDE rows of `harness/f70_partition.tsv`.
     The "ISO-8859 file(s) in src/" DIAGNOSIS was wrong both times: the
     `app_command_interface` pair were UTF-8 with one stray 0xA7 each —
     whole-file Latin-1 decoding mojibakes such files. SECOND hazard, same
     class: `grep -P '[\x80-\xff]'` under a UTF-8 locale matches code points,
     not bytes — `LC_ALL=C` for byte classes. D14 standing gate:
     `python3 harness/f70_ascii.py gate`. CLAUDE.md carries the clean rule.]**
