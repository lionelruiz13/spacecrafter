- **Session-26 decision items (2026-09-07, the NULL-PARENT / PARKED-READOUT / SYSTEM-SWITCH /
  UNIFORM-POOL round — F99 · F100 · F101 · F102, four for four). THE FIRST BLOCK IN Q-70's SHAPE, on
  your word of 2026-09-06: one decision per node, its held set stated at the node, anchors by ID
  and symbol, correlated items placed together; length is a free variable. Nothing asked in-session.**

  ```
  YOURS — nothing here substitutes them
  [Y1] §5.142 · the uniform pool ─ a D13 POLICY in EntityCore
       ANSWERED [vixy 2026-09-12] → §11.233(b): GROW to 1 GiB, fixed, single-session too ("a pool of
       1 Gio is fairly generous and won't be critical either") — F113, session 29; the D13 reading on a
       smaller BAR heap measured there as the veto point on the number
       CORRECTED [vixy 2026-09-12 12:3x] → §11.233(b): "1 GiB was for the logs … app.cpp:274 … should stay
       very small … 1 MiB is sufficient" — my misread; the pool STAYS 1 MiB; asked for a shape he asked the
       ROOT ("why 1344 B … why so many") → F115; the 1 GiB is §5.115's size bound → F116
       fact    1 MiB, created once, never grows; a 06.sts body costs 1344 B on both paths
               (320 old-eager + 1024 new-at-load, alignment 64); the pool runs out at the
               675th body of 06.sts ALONE (reproduced in two launches); 14.sts adds nothing —
               its 527 "stars" are 128-byte in-galaxy OJM models that walk into the empty pool
       GROW    2 MiB holds the whole corpus (1.72 MiB) with 14 % headroom; each MiB = 780
               bodies today / 1024 after B8; on a smaller device the grown pool fails through
               §5.60's own unguarded return ("Failed to create buffer bloc") — silently
       REFUSE  anchor = the load authority (OjmMgr::load already prints both outcomes);
               then the body is ABSENT (§5.50's shape: 339 of 1013 satellites silently gone)
               or PRESENT without its disc (the new path supports it, the old does not)
       DEGRADE meshFrag is 768 of its 784 B of shadowingBodies[8]; a cap of 1 gives 2.1x the
               bodies per byte; the runtime-sized allocation exists, the shader's array does not
       ask     one word: grow / refuse / degrade — and under REFUSE: absent, or disc-less
       →       §11.222(h) · §5.142 · §11.161(b)

  [Y2] §5.145 · RESUME_EXTRA_ITERATIONS = 4 ─ YOUR constant (§11.76(b))
       fact    same date, same binary, only the evaluation count varies:
               5 → Eris 1.198725°  ·  9 → 1.1e-05°  ·  15 → 2.2e-05°
               every "Eris = the trees' own 1.198° gap" since F44 was this (markers placed)
       ask     raise it (9 suffices today; a slower converger moves it again), or a
               convergence criterion at the use (cost priced by F100's evalCount instrument)
       →       §11.220(j1) · §5.145
       ANSWERED [vixy 2026-09-07] → §11.223(b): "double the iterations per cycle for those types of
       orbits only, otherwise it might became slightly noticeable at high simulation speed" — the
       ~~iterative types resume with 1+8, the rest keep 1+4~~ CORRECTED on your second message
       (08:5x): the NEWTON STEPS PER CALL double in the solver of those types — 2+8 at a use, the
       barrier's loop unchanged, every per-frame evaluation twice as fast; §5.84 annotated at the
       fix; orbit.cpp is shared — old converges faster after a date jump (veto point)

  [Y3] §5.146 · the allocator releases a REFUSED SubBuffer into its free list ─ read, not run
       fact    acquireBuffer leaves offset/size indeterminate on refusal; SharedBuffer binds
               through it and its destructor hands the garbage range back (SubBuffer.hpp:6-10,
               BufferMgr.cpp:43-44, SharedBuffer.hpp:9,15-18); the arm-C log cannot separate
               a phantom grant from the landscape's legitimate release
       ask     "read it first" = one discriminating launch (S, next round), or yours
       →       §11.222(g)(6) · §5.146
       ANSWERED [vixy 2026-09-07] → §11.223(c): free's contract, no assertion — "the application must
       ensure only valid allocations are freed"; the fix site is SharedBuffer (the caller) + the
       contract line at BufferMgr::releaseBuffer; EntityCore — minted on your one word "edit it"

  [Y4] R5 · the PUSH ─ master-beta 94 / CC-harness 792 unpushed at 01:29 (before this close)
       ANSWERED [vixy 2026-09-07] → §11.223(d): Saturday/Sunday, "along with supervised_by.sh patching
       of commit history with commit tracking" — B1's silent fallback is fixed FIRST (next round, S);
       ONE LINE THE REWRITE NEEDS: emit and commit the old→new SHA map — 133 pins / 695 trailers
       resolve through it, never by search-and-replace over the record (§11.212)
  [Y5] §5.144 · the 8–12 h cache-vs-leak leg ─ yes / no  (carried from s25, unchanged)
  [Y6] §5.140 · what `orbit_lon` MEANS ─ one word; unblocks §5.21's two halves  (carried)
       ANSWERED [vixy 2026-09-12] → §11.233(e): "that's for the main user/tester, no ?" — ROUTED to the
       tester (§11.207(i)); §5.21's halves stay behind his answer
  [Y7] scratch trees ─ say the word: sc-f99 · sc-f100 · sc-f101 · sc-f102 join s25's list;
       sc-f98 (1.8 G) holds the ONLY complete arm-C applog — keep until [Y3]'s launch

  ROUTED TO THE MAIN TESTER (§11.161(c)), not asked
  [T1] eight of his shows fly above 1e16 (14 · S02 · S07 · S09 · S10 · S12 · S12old · W15):
       is leaving the solar system for good MEANT? a home planet set out there decides
       whether the descent comes home or lands in a fresh empty system   → §11.221(n3)
       ANSWERED BY YOU, not the tester [vixy 2026-09-07] → §11.223(e): 1e16 is the designed inGalaxy
       entry; the mode is to be REMOVED by nested modular bodies (a system = a body seen from
       outside as inGalaxy shows it) — question withdrawn; §5.143 retires with that design
  [T2] 06old.sts lands 156 of 170: 13 duplicate names + TDRS 3 with no coord_func
       (both paths refuse it and say why)                                  → §11.221(g)
  [T3] 06.sts alone aborts the reference binary at its 675th body — one show, not two → [Y1]

  VETO POINTS taken (implemented-and-live, each cheap to reverse; silence = endorsed)
  [V1] F99  the OLD path guarded inside protosystem.cpp's location_orbit branch (a crash
            guard, the §5.50/§11.124(h) precedent; the only path it alters ended in SIGSEGV)
            + the new loader's twin; `parent none` now refused in words on both paths
  [V2] F100 useNow() keyed on (date, parent frame); the +4 bound to a date change; the
            selection's per-frame use costs one 16-float compare (0.0000 refreshes held)
  [V3] F101 dumpread.load_dump raises on an empty old half by default; 4 readers opt out
  [V4] two §5 mints at acceptances (§5.145 [Y2], §5.146 [Y3]); three rows corrected at
            their headlines by the executors' measurements (§5.141, §5.139, §5.143)
  [V5] archival pass 18; this block's shape (Q-70)

  HELD OPEN, not absorbed
  [H1] the dump header names no system — one field, dump channel (S)         → §11.221(n1)
  [H2] the dump calls the barrier for 90 of its 120 records (S)               → §11.220(j3)
  [H3] §5.143 stays OPEN (retires with B8); `search` NOF outside the system (R22)
  [H4] §11.218(g)'s "zero errors after 06+06old" — an F98 executor claim its own log
       refutes; corrected by F102 with markers, the arm-C figures reproduced to the digit

  FACTS, no decision asked
  [F1] your ssh move changed nothing that reaches a launch — measured at open; Q-61(3) holds
  [F2] `select planet` + `get status object` answers the OLD path for every both-tree name:
       a new-path readout needs a new-only name or the dump's sidecar          → §11.220(e1)
  [F3] ten dispatcher defects this round (5 value-class, 5 structure-class), all output-side,
       nine caught before a delivery and one at the close (corrected one commit later); the PREMISES instrument caught one AT THE MINT; two
       executor report defects (F99 self-caught; F98's found by F102 from F98's own log)
