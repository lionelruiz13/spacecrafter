- **Session-13, F37/§11.149 — TWO THINGS TO EQUALIZE ON, both about facts rather
  than decisions (nothing here asks you for a choice):**
  - **Your D37 premise was right and OUR measurement's reading was wrong.** You
    reasoned *"every bodies have the star as parent body, in which case hiding the
    star hide every bodies in the system"*; the ledger had a measurement that
    looked like the opposite (a hidden Sun still lighting the Moon). The probe
    settles it your way: the shipped `ssystem.ini` has **90 body sections and
    exactly one `parent = none` — `[sun]`**, the runtime tree is
    `Moon → Earth → Sun → SolarSystem → MilkyWay → Universe`, **91 of 120 bodies
    sit under the Sun** and the other 28 are system nodes and hidden anchors with
    `boundingRadius = 0`. On the same run's own screenshots, hiding the Sun makes
    the Moon **disappear** (disc interior 4.738 → 0.000). The instrument counted
    the whole frame, which the star field dominates, so it could not see the Moon
    leave (→ new defect **§5.99**; §11.117(k)(1) corrected in place, counts kept).
    **Consequence you may care about**: D37, which is now delegated to the tester,
    has **no observable on shipped content** — both answers give the same frame —
    so the question needs an authored scene or the multi-star case you named. It
    goes to the tester with that fact attached rather than as posed.
  - **The tester rewrote `doc/superscript.sts` this morning** (`30ea1f8d`, +267/−67)
    and **eleven of the thirteen witness lines the ledger tracked are already
    fixed or removed** — including the invisible 0xA0 byte and both respell cases
    (`date_display_*`, `zrot/yrot`). That answers **SS-16** (fix in place vs keep
    as a historical document) **by action**: the historical witness now lives at
    `ff3d1d94:doc/superscript.sts`. Two survive: the `landscape … spacecraft on`
    line and the `$body_selected` number table. **Owed and not done**: the 267
    ADDED lines are unexamined and scedit is not runnable from this working copy,
    so this was a "did the old problems go away" check, not a fresh pass.
