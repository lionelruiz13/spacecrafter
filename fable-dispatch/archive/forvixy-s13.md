- **Session-13 decision items (2026-08-26, F37–F40 / §11.149–§11.153):**
  - **§5.100/§5.101 authorization question (ASKED in-conversation, unanswered at
    close):** does D15(c)'s *"continual tracking must be preserved"* authorize
    the new-path tracking start at `zoom auto in` (one line beside the existing
    `armViewOffset`) and the `autoZoomOut` re-aim mirror (needs a Camera
    `lookTo` + a parity question on old's eased ramp)? Yes ⇒ §5.100 dispatches
    decision-free next round.
  - **A44** — `RingModule`'s shadow caster is the ONE scaled shadow radius, by
    your 2026-07-18 extent contract; D21 points the other way. Unexercised on
    shipped content (no scaled body has rings). Which contract wins?
  - ~~**§5.104** — what should reload re-apply?~~ **ANSWERED [vixy 2026-08-26 →
    §11.154(b)]: ownership FORMAT-SCOPED** — legacy: config.ini owns scaling;
    modular: the new FILE owns it, deprecating config.ini whenever the new
    format serves the solar system. Implementation rides B16's seam; one gate:
    **B28 sign-off on the new-format scaling key** before any emitter writes it.
    **[OPERATED same day → §11.154(c): key = `display_scale` (delegated
    deducibility test rides F41); derivation ratified verbatim; F41 dispatched.]**
  - **§5.106** — entering free flight changes what the ENVIRONMENT draws
    (landscape stops updating, atmosphere floods the dome: 3.3 Mpx — this, not
    the teleport, was §11.144(i)'s pixel count). Old path's own `isOnBody()`
    semantics; what free flight should SHOW is yours — same family as D15(b)
    transparency. **[DE-URGENTED per §11.154(a)'s usage-path model
    (interactive-only path); veto point open: close-as-accepted vs keep the
    design question — the atmosphere-flood sub-question stays owed either way.]**
  - **The two §11.144 riders, now with veto points at their sites (§11.153(e)(f),
    each ≤3 lines to reverse):** free-flight `moveto lat/lon` now names the
    anchored place (restoring `Camera.hpp:195-197`'s own contract) — say the
    word if free flight should give it a DIFFERENT meaning; `get status
    position` across the toggle is byte-identical — say the word if the
    free-flight readout should answer something else.
  - **§5.49 reversal warning** — F40 MEASURED the observer half (pose azimuth =
    `lon − π/2`); composing with the confirmed texture half gives `u = lon/360
    − 0.5`, i.e. `moveto lon 0` over the map's CENTRE — the OPPOSITE of §5.49's
    headline. Both halves stay [derived]; the render measurement the row owes
    (`f14_meridian.py` `u_sub`) settles it before anyone "fixes" §5.49.
  - **§5.105's owed check** — old path dumps uninitialized memory as `dist` for
    never-sorted bodies; owed before acting: is `Body::getDistance()` read
    outside the dump for such a body (instrument-grade vs live defect)?
